Object_Event_atcher sample C++ V5 SDK plug-in
=============================================
Rhino 5 (http://rhino3d.com/) plug-in that watches for object events like adding, replacing or deleting objects in Rhino.

* CPPObjectWatcher - command that opens a dialog box to start watching.  You can call the command again and choose to stop watcing.  A command line comment is added every time an event is detected.

Downloading
------------
NOTE: If you download the rhp file, you may need to right click and "unblock" the file before it can be used in Rhino

Get Involved
------------
If you want to tinker with and possibly add more events, feel free to send me a message on github and we'll try to figure out the best way to make that happen.

You are also welcome to submit bugs and wishlist items for these scripts at https://github.com/rissa/Object_Event_Watcher/issues

Using the Source
----------------
You are going to need the latest Rhino5 Beta (http://www.rhino3d.com/nr.htm)
Start Rhino and run PlugInManager to install the rhp plug-in. Once installed, you should now have the new command available in Rhino.
